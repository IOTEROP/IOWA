IOWA - EVALUATION LICENSE


1. SUBJECT

By clicking on "I accept the present general conditions of License", the user subscribes with SAS IoTerop an evaluation
license agreement (hereafter "the License") for internal exploration and prototyping purposes. The following provisions
define and organize the rights and obligations provided for in the License.


2. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE LICENSE

2.1
The user may test and develop prototypes with the License, but the License may contain only part of the functionality
of IOWA, be composed of non-finished elements, or be under development which may contain significant errors.

2.2
Any commercial exploitation of the functionality of IOWA under this License is therefore prohibited.


3. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE USER

3.1
The Licensee is presumed to be the person downloading and/or first using the License.

3.2
The user may carry out internal evaluations, explorations, prototyping by IOWA on its own products.

3.3
The user is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, revocable at any time, which does not transfer any
ownership rights to the user.

3.4
The user may not grant sub-licenses or make IOWA available to third parties.

3.5
The License is granted for a period of 3 months. At the end of this period, it is automatically terminated and the
User is obliged to destroy the IOWA trial version given to him by IoTerop at the conclusion of the Agreement.

3.6
At the end of these operations the User provides IoTerop with a sworn statement of this destruction. Any violation of
this obligation is likely to characterize the offence of counterfeiting provided for and punished by articles L332.2
and following of the intellectual property code.

3.7
Any use of IOWA that is not explicitly authorized by the License is prohibited.

3.8
Any copy of IOWA made for purposes contrary to the provisions of article L122-6-1 of the Intellectual Property Code
and to the License is prohibited.

3.9
The evaluation version of IOWA is made available in source code. The User therefore takes care in all circumstances
not to test IOWA in a configuration likely to affect IoTerop's intellectual property rights, such as, without this
being exhaustive, association with another source code under open source licenses whose legal provisions would be
likely to degrade IoTerop's rights, in particular by the effect of legal contamination. The User assumes all the
consequences - in particular financial - resulting from the violation of this clause.


4. RESPECT OF IOTEROP'S PATERNITY RIGHTS

4.1
The User shall leave the IOWA copyright notices in a prominent place at all times without changing them.

4.2
These mentions are as follows: 
" * Copyright (c) IoTerop.
* All rights reserved.
*
* This program and the accompanying materials
* are made available under the terms of
* IoTeropâ€™s IOWA License (LICENSE.TXT) which
* accompany this distribution."


5. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS

5.1
IOWA uses functionalities subject to open source license compliance (information provided in the documentation
accompanying IOWA).

5.2
IOWA respects the contents of these open source licenses and assumes responsibility for any action, claim, demand
or opposition that may be made by a right holder under these licenses in connection with the provision of the IOWA
trial version. 

5.3
The user shall also ensure that the content of the open source licenses is respected.

5.4
If the user violates the provisions of the open source licenses, he alone assumes all legal and financial consequences
without attempting to engage the responsibility of IoTerop.


6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

6.1
Given the purpose of this License and the exclusion of any possibility of production, commercial exploitation or legal
operation other than that defined by the License, the proper functioning of IOWA is not guaranteed in its trial
version.

6.2
The user therefore waives any action of any nature whatsoever aimed at seeking the liability of SAS IoTerop due to
direct or indirect malfunctioning of IOWA, the absence of expected operating results from IOWA and more generally any
impossibility of obtaining the desired results from IOWA in the context of the evaluation.

6.3
The user agrees to test IOWA at its own risk and shall bear any harmful consequences of the tests conducted. It is the
responsibility of the user to take all necessary precautions to carry out the tests in an environment that preserves
its installations and/or data.

6.4
The user waives the right to take any action against SAS IoTerop in order to obtain its condemnation, in particular, but
without this being exhaustive, for loss or alteration of data or any other economic or financial damage such as loss of
profits, loss of contracts, loss of profit, loss of image directly or indirectly caused by IOWA.

6.5
This Agreement does not grant the User any maintenance rights of any kind whatsoever.

6.6
The User shall ensure the security of its connections against intrusion, hacking and other malicious acts. He shall be
solely liable for any damage that may be caused in this way. 


7. TERMINATION 

7.1
At the end of the 3-month period, the License is automatically terminated.

7.2
SAS IoTerop may terminate the Licence, 8 working days after a prior formal notice sent by email, in the event of failure
by the user to fulfil any of his obligations.

7.3
Any continued use of the Licence after its expiry is prohibited and is likely to constitute an offence of counterfeiting
as provided for and punishable under articles L335-1 and following of the Intellectual Property Code.


8. CONFIDENTIALITY

8.1
The user is subject to an obligation of confidentiality concerning the technologies developed by IoTerop.

8.2

8.3
This confidential information includes in particular commercial and technical information concerning IOWA : 
- its characteristics and its operating mode, 
- know-how, 
- inventions, 
- techniques, processes, programs, ideas, algorithms, schematics,
- test procedures and results, 
- the appearance of the program and its architecture,

- reports of difficulties, 
- analysis and performance information
- any other information, data, plan or other, of a technical, professional, marketing or financial nature, related to
  IOWA or IoTerop's activity. 

8.4
The obligation of confidentiality is incumbent on the user and all persons working directly or indirectly for or with
him and/or in all the subsidiaries of the group to which he belongs.

8.5
The duration of the obligation of confidentiality is 3 years from the termination of the License. 


9. GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1
The License is subject to French law.

of defendants or third parties.

9.1
In the event that any provision of the contract is declared null and void or inapplicable by a final court decision, the
parties agree to attempt to limit as far as possible the scope of such nullity or inapplicability so that the other
contractual provisions remain in force.
