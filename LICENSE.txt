IOWA - EVALUATION LICENSE


1. SUBJECT

By downloading IOWA, or the code samples, the user subscribes with SAS IoTerop an evaluation license agreement
(hereafter "the License") for internal exploration and prototyping purposes. The following provisions define
and organize the rights and obligations provided for in the License.


2. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE LICENSE

2.1
The user may test and develop prototypes with the License, but the License may contain only part of the functionality
of IOWA, be composed of non-finished elements, or be under development which may contain significant errors.

2.2
Any commercial exploitation of the functionality of IOWA under this License is therefore prohibited.


3. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE USER

3.1
The Licensee is presumed to be the person downloading and/or first using the License.

3.2
The user may carry out internal evaluations, explorations, prototyping by IOWA on its own products.

3.3
The user is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, revocable at any time, which does not transfer any
ownership rights to the user.

3.4
The user may not grant sub-licenses or make IOWA available to third parties.

3.5
Any use of IOWA that is not explicitly authorized by the License is prohibited.

3.6
Any copy of IOWA made for purposes contrary to the provisions of article L122-6-1 of the Intellectual Property Code
and to the License is prohibited.

3.7
The evaluation version of IOWA is made available in source code. The User therefore takes care in all circumstances
not to test IOWA in a configuration likely to affect IoTerop's intellectual property rights, such as, without this
being exhaustive, association with another source code under open source licenses whose legal provisions would be
likely to degrade IoTerop's rights, in particular by the effect of legal contamination. The User assumes all the
consequences - in particular financial - resulting from the violation of this clause.


4. RESPECT OF IOTEROP'S PATERNITY RIGHTS

4.1
The User shall leave the IOWA copyright notices in a prominent place at all times without changing them.

4.2
These mentions are as follows: 
" * Copyright (c) IoTerop.
* All rights reserved.
*
* This program and the accompanying materials
* are made available under the terms of
* IoTeropâ€™s IOWA License (LICENSE.TXT) which
* accompany this distribution."


5. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS

5.1
IOWA uses functionalities subject to open source license compliance (information provided in the documentation
accompanying IOWA).

5.2
IOWA respects the contents of these open source licenses and assumes responsibility for any action, claim, demand
or opposition that may be made by a right holder under these licenses in connection with the provision of the IOWA
trial version. 

5.3
The user shall also ensure that the content of the open source licenses is respected.

5.4
If the user violates the provisions of the open source licenses, he alone assumes all legal and financial consequences
without attempting to engage the responsibility of IoTerop.


6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

6.1
Given the purpose of this License and the exclusion of any possibility of production, commercial exploitation or legal
operation other than that defined by the License, the proper functioning of IOWA is not guaranteed in its trial
version.

6.2
The user therefore waives any action of any nature whatsoever aimed at seeking the liability of SAS IoTerop due to
direct or indirect malfunctioning of IOWA, the absence of expected operating results from IOWA and more generally any
impossibility of obtaining the desired results from IOWA in the context of the evaluation.

6.3
The user agrees to test IOWA at its own risk and shall bear any harmful consequences of the tests conducted. It is the
responsibility of the user to take all necessary precautions to carry out the tests in an environment that preserves
its installations and/or data.

6.4
The user waives the right to take any action against SAS IoTerop in order to obtain its condemnation, in particular, but
without this being exhaustive, for loss or alteration of data or any other economic or financial damage such as loss of
profits, loss of contracts, loss of profit, loss of image directly or indirectly caused by IOWA.

6.5
This Agreement does not grant the User any maintenance rights of any kind whatsoever.

6.6
The User shall ensure the security of its connections against intrusion, hacking and other malicious acts. He shall be
solely liable for any damage that may be caused in this way. 


7. GENERAL PROVISIONS

7.1
The License is subject to French law.

7.2
In the event of a dispute, the competent courts are those of the Montpellier Court of Appeal, notwithstanding plurality
of defendants or third parties.

7.3
In the event that any provision of the contract is declared null and void or inapplicable by a final court decision, the
parties agree to attempt to limit as far as possible the scope of such nullity or inapplicability so that the other
contractual provisions remain in force.
