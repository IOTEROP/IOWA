API \u00b6 iowa_system_malloc \u00b6 Prototype void * iowa_system_malloc ( size_t size ); Description iowa_system_malloc() could map directly to C standard library malloc() . It allocates a memory block. Arguments size The size in bytes of the requested memory block. Return Value A pointer to the allocated memory or NULL in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Note This function is required by IOWA. iowa_system_free \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_free ( void * pointer ); Description iowa_system_free() could map directly to C standard library free() . It releases a memory block previously allocated by iowa_system_malloc() . Arguments pointer A pointer to the memory block to release. Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required by IOWA. From C standard, no action should occur if pointer argument is a null pointer. This is how the function free() from C standard library behaves. However some compilers or implementations do not respect this standard. So it can be necessary when implementing iowa_system_free() to check if the argument pointer is nil. iowa_system_gettime \u00b6 Prototype int32_t iowa_system_gettime ( void ); Description iowa_system_gettime() is used by IOWA to determine the time elapsed. Return Value The number of seconds elapsed since a point of origin or a negative number in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required by IOWA. If you are using the GPS or the Location object, this function will be used to timestamp the measure. In this case, the point of origin must be Epoch. Else, the point of origin (Epoch, system boot, etc...) does not matter as this function is used only to determine the elapsed time between consecutive calls. There is no safeguard if iowa_system_gettime() returns a value inferior to the one returned in a previous call. iowa_system_reboot \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_reboot ( void * userData ); Description iowa_system_reboot() starts a system reboot. Arguments userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only for LwM2M Clients. This feature is required by the Lightweight M2M protocol. However, a LwM2M device can be functional without it and this function can be a stub. iowa_system_trace \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_trace ( const char * format , va_list varArgs ); Description iowa_system_trace() outputs the logs when the stack is built with IOWA_WITH_LOGS . It can be mapped directly to vprintf() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required by IOWA only when logs are activated. See [IOWA_LOG_LEVEL and IOWA_LOG_PART][IOWA_LOG_LEVEL and IOWA_LOG_PART]. IOWA takes care of freeing varArgs after this call returns. To print a single line on the output, this function can be called multiple times. This has an impact when the flag IOWA_THREAD_SUPPORT is enabled. Several calls of iowa_system_trace() can occur from different threads at the same time. And thus, the output can be ruined. The implementation of this function must be thread safe. iowa_system_connection_open \u00b6 Prototype void * iowa_system_connection_open ( iowa_connection_type_t type , char * hostname , char * port , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_connection_open() opens a connection to a host. Arguments type The type of connection to open. hostname The hostname of the peer to connect to. port The port to connect to. It may be NULL depending on the provided server URL. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value A pointer to an user-defined type or NULL in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only for LwM2M Clients. When IOWA is used as a LwM2M Client, it calls this function to connect to the LwM2M Servers. See the iowa_client_add_server() API. iowa_system_connection_send \u00b6 Prototype int iowa_system_connection_send ( void * connP , uint8_t * buffer , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_connection_send() sends a buffer on a connection. Arguments connP The connection as returned by iowa_system_connection_open() . buffer The data to send. length The length of the data in bytes. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The number of bytes sent or a negative number in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required by IOWA. On packet switched networks (eg. UDP), if length is bigger than the MTU, it is advised to not try to send the buffer and return the MTU. iowa_system_connection_get_peer_identifier \u00b6 Prototype size_t iowa_system_connection_get_peer_identifier ( void * connP , uint8_t * addrP , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_connection_get_peer_identifier() returns an unique identifier for the peer of a connection (e.g. IP address, LoRaWAN DevEUI, SMS MSISDN). Arguments connP The connection as returned by iowa_system_connection_open() . addrP A pre-allocated buffer to store the identifier. length The length of addrP in bytes. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The number of bytes of the identifier or 0 in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with [IOWA_SECURITY_LAYER][IOWA_SECURITY_LAYER] different from IOWA_SECURITY_LAYER_NONE , or with LWM2M_SERVER_MODE or LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_MODE flags. This is used when the endpoint name has not been found in the registration payload. iowa_system_connection_recv \u00b6 Prototype int iowa_system_connection_recv ( void * connP , uint8_t * buffer , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_connection_recv() reads data from a connection in a non-blocking way. Arguments connP The connection as returned by iowa_system_connection_open() . buffer A buffer to store the received data. length The length of the buffer in bytes. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The number of received bytes or a negative number in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Note This function is required by IOWA. iowa_system_connection_select \u00b6 Prototype int iowa_system_connection_select ( void ** connArray , size_t connCount , int32_t timeout , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_connection_select() monitors a list of connections for incoming data during the specified time. Arguments connArray An array of connections as returned by iowa_system_connection_open() . connCount The number of elements of connArray. This may be zero. timeout The time to wait for data in seconds. This may be zero. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value either: a positive number if data are available. zero if the time elapsed. a negative number in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required by IOWA. If data are available on one or more connections, iowa_system_connection_select() must modify the connArray elements : If data are available on a connection the matching element in connArray is left untouched. If no data are available, the matching element is set to NULL. If the timeout is reached (or in case of error), there is no need to modify the connArray elements. When the application needs to be very responsive, this function is a good place to monitor application specific events without using a very short timeout in iowa_step() . For instance, the sample server waits for keyboard events here. It is possible that IOWA calls iowa_system_connection_select() with a timeout of zero. In this case, iowa_system_connection_select() must not return an error, and should check if some data are already available on one of the connections. It is also possible that IOWA calls iowa_system_connection_select() with no connections. In this case, iowa_system_connection_select() must not return an error, and should return after the timeout, which may also be zero, expires. This can occur when opening a connection to a LwM2M Server failed and IOWA is configured to wait a specific time before retrying to connect to the LwM2M Server. iowa_system_connection_interrupt_select \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_connection_interrupt_select ( void * userData ); Description A call to iowa_system_connection_interrupt_select() makes iowa_system_connection_select() return immediately if it is currently running. Arguments userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the IOWA_MULTITHREAD_SUPPORT flag. The value returned by iowa_system_connection_select() is zero. Calling iowa_system_connection_interrupt_select() is considered as a preemptive timeout for iowa_system_connection_select() . iowa_system_connection_close \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_connection_close ( void * connP , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_connection_close() closes a connection. Arguments connP The connection as returned by iowa_system_connection_open() . userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Note This function is required by IOWA. iowa_system_queue_create \u00b6 Prototype void * iowa_system_queue_create ( void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_create() creates a storage queue to offload data from the memory. Arguments userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value A pointer to an user-defined type or NULL in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_SUPPORT or LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_PEEK_SUPPORT flags. The storage queue must store data as separate entities and not as as a stream. Ideally, this is a FIFO. iowa_system_queue_delete \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_queue_delete ( void * queueP , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_delete() closes a storage queue. Arguments queueP A storage queue as returned by iowa_system_queue_create() . userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_SUPPORT or LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_PEEK_SUPPORT flags. iowa_system_queue_enqueue \u00b6 Prototype int iowa_system_queue_enqueue ( void * queueP , uint8_t * buffer , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_enqueue() stores data in a storage queue. Arguments queueP A storage queue as returned by iowa_system_queue_create() . buffer The data to store. length The length of the data in bytes. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The number of stored bytes or a negative number in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_SUPPORT or LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_PEEK_SUPPORT flags. The data must be stored as a single entity. iowa_system_queue_dequeue \u00b6 Prototype size_t iowa_system_queue_dequeue ( void * queueP , uint8_t * buffer , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_dequeue() retrieves an entity from a storage queue or, the provided buffer is too small, it returns the size of the next entity to retrieve. Arguments queueP A storage queue as returned by iowa_system_queue_create() . buffer A buffer to store the retrieved data. This can be nil. length The length of the buffer in bytes. This can be zero. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The size in bytes of retrieved entity or zero if the queue is empty or in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_SUPPORT flag. If the provided buffer is nil or too small to contain the entity to retrieve, the entity is not removed from the queue. iowa_system_queue_peek \u00b6 Prototype size_t iowa_system_queue_peek ( void * queueP , uint8_t * buffer , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_peek() peeks a entity from a storage queue or, if the provided buffer is too small, it returns the size of the next entity to peek. Arguments queueP A storage queue as returned by iowa_system_queue_create() . buffer A buffer to store the retrieved data. This can be nil. length The length of the buffer in bytes. This can be zero. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The size in bytes of peeked entity or zero if the queue is empty or in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_PEEK_SUPPORT flag. iowa_system_queue_remove \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_queue_remove ( void * queueP , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_remove() removes the first entity of a storage queue. Arguments queueP A storage queue as returned by iowa_system_queue_create() . userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the LWM2M_STORAGE_QUEUE_PEEK_SUPPORT flag. iowa_system_queue_backup \u00b6 Prototype size_t iowa_system_queue_backup ( void * queueP , uint8_t * buffer , size_t length , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_queue_backup() returns a blob of data necessary to recreate a storage queue, or if the provided buffer is too small, the size of this blob of data. Arguments queueP A storage queue as returned by iowa_system_queue_create() . buffer A buffer to store the blob of data. This can be nil. length The length of buffer in bytes. This can be zero. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The size in bytes of the blob of data to save or zero in case of error.

Arguments bufferP The destination buffer. length Length of the buffer. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The number of stored bytes or a zero in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the IOWA_STORAGE_CONTEXT_SUPPORT flag. iowa_system_retrieve_context \u00b6 Prototype size_t iowa_system_retrieve_context ( uint8_t ** bufferP , void * userData ); Description iowa_system_retrieve_context() retrieves an IOWA context. Arguments bufferP The buffer containing the retrieved data. userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value The size in bytes of retrieved data or zero if there is nothing or in case of error. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the IOWA_STORAGE_CONTEXT_SUPPORT flag. bufferP must be allocated by the function. The buffer will next be freed by IOWA internally. iowa_system_mutex_lock \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_system_mutex_lock ( void * userData ); Description iowa_system_mutex_lock() locks a mutex for the current thread. Arguments userData The argument passed to iowa_init() . Return Value None. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is required only if IOWA is built with the IOWA_MULTITHREAD_SUPPORT flag.

Return Value IOWA_COAP_NO_ERROR success. IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND the security data based on peerIdentity has not been found (only when the security operation is not IOWA_SEC_CREATE ). IOWA_COAP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE the security data based on peerIdentity already exists (only when the security operation is IOWA_SEC_CREATE ). IOWA_COAP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR a memory allocation failed. Header File iowa_platform.h Notes This function is only required if IOWA is built with IOWA_SECURITY_LAYER different from IOWA_SECURITY_LAYER_NONE . The IOWA_SEC_DELETE operation is only used if a IOWA_SEC_CREATE operation happened. The IOWA_SEC_CREATE operation is only used on bootstrapping. Regarding the memory allocation: On a IOWA_SEC_CREATE operation, the data is allocated by the stack. So the deallocation MUST not be done by the application. On a IOWA_SEC_READ operation, the data if needed is allocated by the application. The stack does not deallocate it.

IOWA_COAP_409_CONFLICT this object already exists. Call first iowa_client_remove_custom_object() . Header File iowa_client.h Notes Object IDs 0, 1 and 3 are reserved and cannot be used. Per Lightweight M2M specification, the ID of the instance of a single-instance Object is 0. When creating a single-instance Object, you can set instanceCount to zero and instanceCallback to nil. IOWA will automatically create an instance with ID 0. When the LwM2M Server creates a new instance of the custom object, instanceCallback is first called with the new instance ID then dataCallback is called with operation set to IOWA_DM_WRITE to initialize the instance. Thus if instanceCallback is defined, dataCallback must handle the Write operation even on resources declared as read-only. iowa_client_remove_custom_object \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_client_remove_custom_object ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint16_t objectID ); Description iowa_client_remove_custom_object() removes a custom Object created with iowa_client_add_custom_object() .

Header File iowa_client.h Notes This API does not check if the LwM2M Object resource exists. That's why this API does not return IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND. Actually, iowa_client_object_resource_changed() is only searching a match between the running observation and the URI provided. If a match is found a notification is sent, else nothing happens. iowa_client_object_instance_changed \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_client_object_instance_changed ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint16_t objectID , uint16_t instanceID , iowa_dm_operation_t operation ); Description iowa_client_object_instance_changed() informs the IOWA stack that an instance of a LwM2M Object was created or deleted.

Return Value IOWA_COAP_NO_ERROR success. IOWA_COAP_403_FORBIDDEN shortID is zero. IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND shortID does not match any known server. IOWA_COAP_412_PRECONDITION_FAILED client is not connected to the server with shortID . This can happen when: The Server is a Bootstrap Server and the Client is already connect to a Server. The Client is configured with more than one Server and has established the connection with only one. IOWA_COAP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR a memory allocation failed. IOWA_COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE heartbeat message has not been sent by the platform. Header File iowa_client.h Notes If shortID is equal to IOWA_LWM2M_ID_ALL , the heartbeat message will be sent to all servers. For non LoRaWAN Servers, a registration update message is sent to the Server. The iowa_event_callback_t will be called with a IOWA_EVENT_REG_UPDATING event. Then, if a reply is received from the Server, the iowa_event_callback_t will be called with either a IOWA_EVENT_REG_REGISTERED or IOWA_EVENT_REG_FAILED event. Nothing is done when no reply is received from the Server. In the IOWA_EVENT_REG_REGISTERED case, the registration lifetime timer for the LwM2M Server is resetted. iowa_client_send_sensor_data \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_client_send_sensor_data ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint16_t shortId , iowa_sensor_uri_t * sensorUriP , size_t sensorUriCount , iowa_response_callback_t responseCb , void * userDataP ); Description iowa_client_send_sensor_data() sends data from iowa_sensor_t to server.

LwM2M Concepts \u00b6 LwM2M Client/Device \u00b6 The LwM2M Client/Device is the entity being managed by the LwM2M Server. The LwM2M Client presents resources for the LwM2M Server to manipulate. LwM2M Server \u00b6 The LwM2M Server is the entity managing the LwM2M Devices. It can Read, Write, Execute, Create or Delete the Devices resources. The LwM2M Server URI can have one of the following formats: \"coap://{hostname}[:{port}]\" for unsecure UDP transport \"coaps://{hostname}[:{port}]\" for secure UDP transport (using DTLS) \"coap+tcp://{hostname}[:{port}]\" for unsecure TCP transport \"coaps+tcp://{hostname}[:{port}]\" for secure TCP transport (using TLS) \"sms://{msisdn number}\" for SMS binding in binary mode \"lorawan://{FPort}\" for LoRaWAN binding with FPort between 1 and 255 For UDP and TCP transports, if {port} is not present, the default port is used: 5683 for communication without security 5684 for secure communication LwM2M Bootstrap Server \u00b6 The LwM2M Bootstrap Server is a special [LwM2M Server][LwM2M Server]. It is the only Server allowed to provision or delete Server Accounts on the LwM2M Devices. It can Read (LwM2M 1.1), Write, Create and Delete the Devices resources. LwM2M Resource \u00b6 A LwM2M Resource is a data item presented by the LwM2M Device. A resource has a data type, a list of allowed operations and a unique URI. Data types are defined in Lightweight M2M as follows: signed integer, unsigned integer, float, boolean, UTF-8 string, core link string, opaque binary, Unix time, reference to a LwM2M Object. A resource can also be an array of the mentioned data types. Operations on resources are Read, Write and Execute. LwM2M Objects \u00b6 The LwM2M Objects are a group of Device resources essential for some Device features such as firmware update, connectivity monitoring, physical sensor, etc. Standardized LwM2M Objects contain mandatory resources to support and optional resources to implement. A LwM2M Device can have several instances of the same LwM2M Object. All the Device resources are part of a LwM2M Object. LwM2M Object Instance \u00b6 Some LwM2M Objects are defined as multi-instance objects, meaning that a LwM2M Device can have several instances of the same LwM2M Object. These instances are identified by a numerical instance ID. When a LwM2M Object is defined as a single-instance, the instance ID is always 0. LwM2M URI \u00b6 Resources and Objects have well-known IDs. The URI to a LwM2M resource is in the form: Object_ID [\"/\" Object_Instance_ID [\"/\" Resource_ID [\"/\" Resource_Instance_ID]]] An URI can address an object, an object instance, a resource or a resource instance (i.e. an element when the resource is an array). Server Account \u00b6 A Server Account is a set of data enabling a LwM2M Device to connect to a LwM2M Server. It includes the Server URI and the Security Keys to use. Bootstrap \u00b6 A Bootstrap is the process by which the Device retrieves the Server Accounts. The information can come from factory settings, a SmartCard, or a LwM2M Bootstrap Server. Registration \u00b6 A LwM2M Server can only manage Devices registered with it. When registering with the Bootstrap Server, the Device communicates only its unique ID. When registering with the LwM2M Server, the Device can communicate: its unique ID, its lifetime, the list of LwM2M Objects implemented on the Device, its MSISDN, whether the Device requires Queue Mode or not. Observation \u00b6 The LwM2M Server can subscribe to one or several readable Device resources. When the value of the resource changes, the Device sends a Notification message to the Server containing the new value of the resource. Lifetime \u00b6 The Lifetime is the validity period of a LwM2M Device registration to the LwM2M Server. When this lifetime expires, the Server should no longer try to manage the Device. The Device sends Registration Update messages to the Server to renew its registration validity period. Queue Mode \u00b6 Devices may go in stand-by mode and thus not be reachable by the LwM2M Servers at any time. To cope with this, the Device requests the Server to operate in Queue Mode. In this mode, the Device will initiate the communication with the Server (when sending a Notification or a Registration Update message). In the meantime, the Server is expected to queue its requests (hence the name). SMS Trigger \u00b6 A SMS Trigger is a special SMS sent to the Device. Upon reception of this SMS, the Device will either register to the Server or send a Registration Update message. LwM2M Operations Overview \u00b6 Bootstrap \u00b6 When an endpoint is registered to a LwM2M Bootstrap Server, it can be managed by performing LwM2M operations on the endpoint's resources. The LwM2M operations are: Bootstrap Finish, Bootstrap Read, Bootstrap Write, Bootstrap Delete, Bootstrap Discover. Bootstrap Request \u00b6 The first action of LwM2M Client is to connect to the LwM2M Bootstrap Server and ask a Bootstrap Request. The Bootstrap Request message contains an endpoint\u2019s unique ID. Bootstrap Finish \u00b6 A Bootstrap Finish operation is sent by the LwM2M Bootstrap Server. Upon reception of this operation, the LwM2M Client will perform a Bootstrap Consistency check to verify the Bootstrap information received from the LwM2M Bootstrap Server is valid. This means at least one LwM2M server is configured on the LwM2M Client. Bootstrap Read \u00b6 In LwM2M 1.1 or later, a Bootstrap Read operation can target the LwM2M Objects Access Control List or Server, or their LwM2M Object Instances. The endpoint returns data encoded in either TLV, JSON, SenML CBOR, or SenML JSON. Bootstrap Write \u00b6 A Bootstrap Write operation targets a LwM2M Object Instance. It contains data encoded in either TLV or JSON. The payload does not need to contain values for all the Object's resources. In LwM2M 1.1 or in later version, it contains data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Bootstrap Delete \u00b6 A Bootstrap Delete operation can target the root path, a LwM2M Object or a LwM2M Instance Object. Bootstrap Discover \u00b6 A Bootstrap Discover operation can target the root path or a LwM2M Object. The endpoint returns only the list of Objects and Object Instances with some attributes: LwM2M Enabler version (\"lwm2m=\"), Short Server ID (\"ssid=\"), and LwM2M Server URI (\"uri=\"). Registration \u00b6 Initial Registration \u00b6 The first action of LwM2M Client is to register to the LwM2M Server. The registration message contains an endpoint\u2019s unique ID and information about its capabilities (in the form of LwM2M Objects). The registration message also contains a lifetime parameter. When this lifetime expires, the LwM2M Server cancels the LwM2M Client registration. The LwM2M Server replies with a \"location\". This location is a handle to the registration. The endpoint uses this handle to update or cancel its registration. Registration Update \u00b6 To keep its registration active or in case the list of LwM2M Objects is modified, the endpoint sends a Registration Update message. Upon reception of this message, the LwM2M Server resets its internal lifetime timer. De-registration \u00b6 To cancel its registration, the LwM2M Client sends a De-registration message. The LwM2M Server may also automatically cancel an endpoint's registration if the registration lifetime expires. Device Management and Service Enablement \u00b6 When an endpoint is registered to a LwM2M Server, it can be managed by performing LwM2M operations on the endpoint's resources. The LwM2M operations are: Read, Write, Execute, Discover, Create, Delete, Read composite, Write composite. Read \u00b6 A Read operation can target a LwM2M Object, a LwM2M Object Instance or a LwM2M Resource. The endpoint returns data encoded in either TLV or JSON. For a single resource, a text encoding is possible. In LwM2M 1.1 or later, the endpoint returns data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Write \u00b6 A Write operation targets a LwM2M Object Instance. It contains data encoded in either TLV or JSON. The payload does not need to contain values for all the Object's resources. In LwM2M 1.1 or in later version, it contains data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Execute \u00b6 An Execute operation can only target a LwM2M Resource. Discover \u00b6 A Discover operation can target a LwM2M Object, a LwM2M Object Instance or a LwM2M Resource. Create \u00b6 A Create operation can target a LwM2M Object. It creates a new Object Instance. Delete \u00b6 A Delete operation can target a LwM2M Object Instance. It deletes an Object Instance. Read composite \u00b6 In LwM2M 1.1 or in later version, a Read composite operation can selectively Read a number of Resources, and/or Resource Instances of different Objects in a single request. The endpoint returns data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Write composite \u00b6 In LwM2M 1.1 or in later version, a Write composite operation can update values of a number of different Resources across different Instances of one or more Objects in a single request. It contains data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Information Reporting \u00b6 When a LwM2M Client is registered to a LwM2M Server, its resources can be observed. Whenever the value of the resource changes, the LwM2M Client sends a notification to the LwM2M Server. Moreover in LwM2M 1.1, the Client can send data to the LwM2M Server without initial solicitation. The LwM2M operations are: Observation, Observation composite, Cancel Observation, Write attributes, Send. Observation \u00b6 An observation can target a LwM2M Object, a LwM2M Object Instance or a LwM2M Resource. Observe composite \u00b6 In LwM2M 1.1 or in later version, a Observe composite operation can initiate observations or selectively read a group of Object, Object Instance, Resources, and/or Resource Instances of different Objects in a single request. The endpoint returns data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Notification \u00b6 When an observed resource's value changes, the endpoint sends a notification message to the LwM2M Server. Cancel Observation \u00b6 The LwM2M Server can cancel an on-going observation. Write attributes \u00b6 The LwM2M Server can set the parameters of an observation. The following attributes are: Name Level Description pmin Object, Object Instance, Resource The minimum period in seconds to wait between notifications. pmax Object, Object Instance, Resource The maximum period in seconds to wait between notifications. gt Numerical Resource An upper threshold. A notification is sent when the resource value crosses this threshold. lt Numerical Resource A lower threshold. A notification is sent when the resource value crosses this threshold. st Numerical Resource A minimum difference in a resource value for a notification to be sent. epmin Object, Object Instance, Resource The minimum sample time in seconds for the observed sensor in LwM2M 1.1 or in later version. epmax Object, Object Instance, Resource The maximum sample time in seconds for the observed sensor in LwM2M 1.1 or in later version. Setting an attribute is in the form Name \"=\" value with some constraints: lt value < gt value lt value + 2 * st value < gt value If pmax < pmin , pmax is ignored epmax > epmin Clearing an attribute is in the form Name . Examples \u00b6 Receiving a notification every minute at most even if the observed URI did not change: \"pmax=60\" . Receiving only one notification per hour even if the observed URI changed several times per minute: \"pmin=3600\" . Receiving exactly one notification every sixty seconds: \"pmin=59&pmax=60\" . Receiving a notification when the resource value exceeds 95 or falls below 10, and when the resource value returns below 95 or above 10: \"lt=10&gt=95\" . Clearing the previously set minimum period and setting a maximum period of five minutes: \"pmin&pmax=300\" . Send \u00b6 In LwM2M 1.1 or in later version, a Send operation is used by the LwM2M Client to send data to the LwM2M Server without explicit request by that Server. It contains data encoded in either SenML CBOR or SenML JSON. Later in the documentation, the Send operation is called a Data Push.

See iowa_connection_type_t . connP The new connection of the same user-defined type as the one returned by iowa_system_connection_open() . isSecure Set to true if the security must be enabled on this connection. Return Value IOWA_COAP_NO_ERROR success. IOWA_COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE either: a memory allocation failed. type is unsupported. Header File iowa_server.h iowa_server_configure_data_push \u00b6 Prototype void iowa_server_configure_data_push ( iowa_context_t contextP , iowa_response_callback_t responseCb , void * userDataP ); Description iowa_server_configure_data_push() enables/disables the Data push operation for all clients. Arguments contextP An iowa_context_t as returned by iowa_init() . Not checked at runtime. responseCb The callback called when a client pushes data. If this callback is nil, data push possibility is disabled. userDataP A pointer to application specific data. This is passed as argument to responseCb . This can be nil. Return Value None. Header File iowa_server.h Notes The responseCb will be called with the operation set to IOWA_DM_DATA_PUSH and the status code set to IOWA_COAP_205_CONTENT . To be able to use this function, [ LWM2M_DATA_PUSH_SUPPORT ][LWM2M_DATA_PUSH_SUPPORT] must be defined. iowa_server_read \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_server_read ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint32_t clientId , size_t uriCount , iowa_lwm2m_uri_t * uriP , iowa_response_callback_t responseCb , void * userDataP ) Description iowa_server_read() performs a Read operation on Client\u2019s URIs.

IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND clientId does not match a known client. IOWA_COAP_413_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE The Platform abstraction didn't send all the data. One possible assumption is the packet was too large for the transport. IOWA_COAP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR A memory allocation failed. IOWA_COAP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED uriCount is superior to 1 with [ LWM2M_READ_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT ][LWM2M_READ_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT] not defined. IOWA_COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE Communication with the LwM2M Client failed. Header File iowa_server.h Notes Per LwM2M specification, if the Read was successful, the Client will return a IOWA_COAP_205_CONTENT status code. The ability to read several URIs at once is only present in LwM2M version 1.1 or later, this means that to use it LWM2M_VERSION_1_1_SUPPORT must be defined. This feature is only operational on SenML JSON and SenML CBOR data encoding, so LWM2M_SUPPORT_SENML_JSON or LWM2M_SUPPORT_SENML_CBOR must be defined. Some LwM2M Clients may not be able to read on several URIs in a single operation. In this case the resultCb will be called with an error status, typically IOWA_COAP_405_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED . Per LwM2M specification, when handling a read on several URIs in a single operation, the LwM2M Client treats the request as non-atomic and handles it as best effort. Hence the reply may not contain the values of all the requested URIs. The responseCb will be called with the operation set to IOWA_DM_READ . iowa_server_observe \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_server_observe ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint32_t clientId , size_t uriCount , iowa_lwm2m_uri_t * uriP , iowa_response_callback_t responseCb , void * userDataP , uint16_t * observeIdP ); Description iowa_server_observe() begins an observation on a Client\u2019s URI. Arguments contextP An iowa_context_t as returned by iowa_init() . Not checked at runtime. clientId The ID of the client as reported in the iowa_monitor_callback_t . uriCount, uriP An array of the URIs to observe. responseCb The callback called when the reply to this operation is known. userDataP A pointer to application specific data. This is passed as argument to responseCb . This can be nil. observeIdP Used to store the ID of the observation. Return Value IOWA_COAP_NO_ERROR success. IOWA_COAP_400_BAD_REQUEST Either: responseCb is nil. observeIdP is nil. uriCount is zero or uriP is nil. uriP targets Object ID IOWA_LWM2M_ID_ALL and [ LWM2M_READ_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT ][LWM2M_READ_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT] is not defined. uriP targets Object ID IOWA_LWM2M_ID_ALL , [ LWM2M_READ_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT ][LWM2M_READ_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT] is defined, but uriCount is not equal to 1. At least one uriP is invalid: instanceId is equal to IOWA_LWM2M_ID_ALL but resourceId is not equal to IOWA_LWM2M_ID_ALL . IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND clientId does not match a known client. IOWA_COAP_412_PRECONDITION_FAILED Observe was already launched. observeIdP is set to the value of the previous observation. IOWA_COAP_413_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE The Platform abstraction didn't send all the data. One possible assumption is the packet was too large for the transport. IOWA_COAP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR A memory allocation failed. IOWA_COAP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED uriCount is superior to 1 with [ LWM2M_OBSERVE_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT ][LWM2M_OBSERVE_COMPOSITE_SUPPORT] not defined. IOWA_COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE Communication with the LwM2M Client failed. Header File iowa_server.h Notes Per LwM2M specification, if the Observe was successful, the Client will return a IOWA_COAP_205_CONTENT status code with the first notification. The responseCb will be called with the operation set to IOWA_DM_NOTIFY : When the observation is internally deleted, responseCb will be called with status to IOWA_COAP_202_DELETED . When the client deregisters or when the connection with the client is lost, responseCb will be called with status to IOWA_COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE . Some LwM2M Clients may not be able to observe on several URIs in a single operation. In this case the responseCb will be called with an error status, typically IOWA_COAP_405_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED . When using an unreliable communication layer, notifications may be lost or arrive out of order. iowa_server_observe_cancel \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_server_observe_cancel ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint32_t clientId , uint16_t observeId ); Description iowa_server_observe_cancel() cancels an observation on a Client. Arguments contextP An iowa_context_t as returned by iowa_init() . Not checked at runtime. clientId The ID of the client as reported in the iowa_monitor_callback_t . observeId The ID of the observation as returned by iowa_server_observe . Return Value IOWA_COAP_NO_ERROR success. IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND either: clientId does not match a known client. observeId does not match a known observation. IOWA_COAP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR A memory allocation failed. IOWA_COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE Communication with the LwM2M Client failed. Header File iowa_server.h Notes When using an unreliable communication layer, the cancellation request from the LwM2M Server to the LwM2M Client may be lost. However the observation is always cancelled. iowa_server_write \u00b6 Prototype iowa_status_t iowa_server_write ( iowa_context_t contextP , uint32_t clientId , size_t dataCount , iowa_lwm2m_data_t * dataArrayP , iowa_response_callback_t responseCb , void * userDataP ) Description iowa_server_write() performs a Write operation on a Client. Arguments contextP An iowa_context_t as returned by iowa_init() . Not checked at runtime. clientId The ID of the client as reported in the iowa_monitor_callback_t . dataCount, dataArrayP The data to write. responseCb The callback called when the reply to this operation is known. This can be nil. userDataP A pointer to application specific data. This is passed as argument to responseCb . This can be nil. Return Value IOWA_COAP_NO_ERROR success. IOWA_COAP_400_BAD_REQUEST Either: dataCount is zero or dataArrayP is nil. dataArrayP[x].objectID or dataArrayP[x].instanceID or dataArrayP[x].resourceID is IOWA_LWM2M_ID_ALL . dataArrayP contains several data with incorrect type. IOWA_COAP_404_NOT_FOUND clientId does not match a known client. IOWA_COAP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE either: dataArrayP contains several data with different objectID or instanceID but LWM2M_SUPPORT_SENML_JSON or LWM2M_SUPPORT_SENML_CBOR are not defined. dataArrayP contains several data with defined timestamp. dataArrayP contains several data of unsigned integer type which are negative.
