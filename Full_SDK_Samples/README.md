# IOWA Full SDK Samples

To use these samples, you need the [IOWA Full SDK](https://ioterop.com/iowa/).

You can either copy the IOWA Full SDK to the **iowa** folder at the root of the repo, or you can edit the root **CMakeLists.txt** to indicate the path to the IOWA Full SDK by modifying the line 14:

```
set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY iowa_sdk_folder "PATH_TO_THE_IOWA_SDK")
```
