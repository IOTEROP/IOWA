Fifteen men on the dead man's chest,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
Drink and the devil had done for the rest,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

For they drank and drank and got so drunk,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
Each from the dead man bit a chunk,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

The bottle burst and the men accurst,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
Sucked his blood to quench their thirst,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

They sucked his blood and crunched his bones,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
When suddenly up came Davy Jones,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

'My men,' says he, 'you must come with me,'
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
And he grinned with a horrible kind of glee,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

Davy Jones had a big black key,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
It was for his locker beneath the sea,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

He winked and he blinked like an owl in a tree,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
And he sank them all to the bottom of the sea,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

Now, all take warning from this 'ere song,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
Never drink whisky so divilish strong,
⁠Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
